# N warriors with health H_i and damage D_i are fighting the boss which deals damage B.
# Choose two warriors to go into battle so that they deal the greatest damage, and tell
# how long they will last.
#
# Eg first two warriors deal combined damage to the boss, until the frontline warrior
# is defeated, then the second warrior keeps dealing damage until the second one is
# defeated.
#
# --------
#
# ok, the problem is about maximizing H_i * (D_i + D_j) + H_j * D_j - and the result is
# that number divided by B, as the first warrior will be defeated in H_i / B amount of
# time, and the second warrior in H_j / B amount of time.
#
# So for each pair of (i, j) we can choose the order. But going through all pairs is too
#Â slow - it will be O(N^2), so we need to eliminate checking some pairs.
#
# Suppose we know (i, j) is the best pair for a sublist of warriors. Then considering
# another warrior, k, we can tell that if (i, k) or (j, k) is the new best pair among
# i, j and k, then we don't need to compare k to the rest of warriors in the sublist
# where i and j were the best pair.
#
# ---
# Hmmm... one of the tests doesn't pass
