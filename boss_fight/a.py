# N warriors with health H_i and damage D_i are fighting the boss which deals damage B.
# Choose two warriors to go into battle so that they deal the greatest damage, and tell
# how long they will last.
#
# Eg first two warriors deal combined damage to the boss, until the frontline warrior
# is defeated, then the second warrior keeps dealing damage until the second one is
# defeated.
#
# --------
#
# ok, the problem is about maximizing H_i * (D_i + D_j) + H_j * D_j - and the result is
# that number divided by B, as the first warrior will be defeated in H_i / B amount of
# time, and the second warrior in H_j / B amount of time.
#
# So for each pair of (i, j) we can choose the order. But going through all pairs is too
#Â slow - it will be O(N^2), so we need to eliminate checking some pairs.
#
# Suppose we know (i, j) is the best pair for a sublist of warriors. Then considering
# another warrior, k, we can tell that if (i, k) or (j, k) is the new best pair among
# i, j and k, then we don't need to compare k to the rest of warriors in the sublist
# where i and j were the best pair.
#
# ...But...eh... this is broken, as the counterexample with [(1, 5), (10, 3), (10, 3), (16, 5)]
# shows: after considering [(10, 3), (10, 3)], it disregards (1, 5) completely, and
# converges on [(16, 5), (10, 3)] as the best choice, which is not correct; the best choice
# should be [(16, 5), (1, 5)].
#
# ---
#
# For a given warrior H_a, D_a, if we were to choose it as the second, the battle outcome
# is determined by the first warrior (h, d) like so: f(h, d) = h * (d + D_a) + H_a * D_a
#
# Then for two warriors we can tell when pairing with one is better than with the other:
# h * (d + D_a) + H_a * D_a > h * (d + D_b) + H_b * D_b
# h * (D_a - D_b) > H_b * D_b - H_a * D_a
#
# Without loss of generality, suppose D_a > D_b. Then if H_b * D_b <= H_a * D_a, pairing up
# with warrior a is always better; otherwise there is a point when it is better to pair up
# with warrior b - for warriors with health less than (H_b * D_b - H_a * D_a)/(D_a - D_b)
#
# We can then rank all warriors, and end up with a list of seconds whose D_a is strictly
# increasing, and H_a * D_a is strictly decreasing.
#
# According to this, (10, 3) is a better second than (1, 5) only for warriors with health
# less than 12.5, which is apparent if you look at the printout of each-with-each, and
# consider only those pairs where the second is either (10, 3) or (1, 5).
#
# ---
#
# So we need to organize the warriors in a sorted list ordered by the "deciding" health level
# of the first warrior:
#
# ..., (h_i, w_i), (h_i+1, w_i+1), ...
#
# such that for any warrior w_i it is a better second than w_i+1 for health of the first warrior
# less than h_i+1. Consequently, w_i is better than w_i-1 for health of the first warrior
# greater than h_i.
#
# We can add new warriors to such a list in O(log N) time, using binary search for insertion
# point, starting from the middle of the list:
# - if w_i is better than W for health less than H > h_i, we insert in the right sublist.
# - if W is better than w_i for health less than H < h_i, we insert in the left sublist.
# - if w_i is better than W for any health, we discard W.
# - if W is better than w_i for any health, we discard the left sublist, and insert in the right sublist.
#
# So we build such a structure for all N warriors in O(N * logN) time, then in O(N) find the
# best first warrior and his runner-up. If the best first warrior is the same as the second,
# we may be are pairing up this warrior with himself. If runner-up is also the same as the best,
# then we are not pairing up this warrior with himself - we are pairing up the best and the
# runner-up. Otherwise we remove the best warrior from the list, and rebuild the structure,
# and see if the best warrior we found before still pairs up with the same warrior; if so,
# we know there are more than one warrior like that, and we are not pairing the warrior with
# himself; otherwise, we choose the best battle cost from this pairing-up and the runner-up
# from the first round.
